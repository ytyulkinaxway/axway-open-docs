## Installation

* To **update** your API Gateway, see [Update from API Gateway One Version](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion/).
* To **upgrade** from an older version, see [Upgrade from API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).
* For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).
* For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

### Update a container deployment

Any custom `.fed` files deployed to a container must be upgraded using [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) or [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options). They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not. The `.fed` files contain the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Manage timeouts on Connection and ConnectToUrl filters

Timeout settings can now be set on the Connection and ConnectToUrl filters. This change will allow for specific calls to timeout at different times based on your use-case. For more information, please see [Connect to URL filter](/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_polref/routing_common/#connect-to-url-filter)

### Querystring passthrough

Placeholder for Padraic/Cian... Jira down at the moment

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update, which may impact on your current installation.

### New redaction rules for API Gateway

New redaction rules have been defined for both [Admin Node Manager](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/admin_node_mngr/) and and the gateway instances. New API Gateway installations now have these rules enabled by default.

When upgrading existing installations, the default redaction files will be automatically installed.

The new default rules are not included in existing configurations, so you must modify your product's configuration files manually to include the new redaction files.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
In order to have a redaction output compatible with API Gateway versions older than **May 2022 update**, observe the following:

* If the tag `action` is not present in new rules, the default action will be `replace`.
* If the tag `replaceBy` is not present, redaction will replace `multipart/form-data` values by an empty string, and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` values by the string `null`.
{{< /alert >}}

For more information on how to configure redaction and the format of new redaction rules, see [Redaction Rules](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/admin_redactors/).

### OpenJDK JRE

API Gateway and API Manager 7.7 and later now support Zulu OpenJDK 1.8.0_322. This version of OpenJDK disables TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 by default. If you wish to enable these algorithms in your API Gateway, add the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` Java security property to the jvm.xml file as follows, where `value` contains the list of disabled algorithms.

```xml
<SecurityProperty name="jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms" value="" />
```

### Axway Terms and Conditions must be accepted to install

Updated General Terms and Conditions (T&C) have been added to API Gateway. During installation in interactive mode a pop-up window is shown for you to accept the T&C. In unattended mode, a new parameter (`ACCEPT_GENERAL_CONDITIONS`) has been introduced, which must be set to yes in order to run the installation.

For more information, see [Acceptance of General Conditions for license and subscription services](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/#acceptance-of-general-conditions-for-license-and-subscription-services).

### Cassandra upgrade postponed

During development and testing of API Gateway with Cassandra 3.11.12, a critical issue was found in Cassandra, see [CASSANDRA-17581](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17581). API Gateway will be upgraded to use Cassandra 3.11.13 instead, in a future version.

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### Scripting filter whiteboard attributes not preloaded for Jython scripts

The Scripting filter now uses a Jython 2.7 scripting environment (previously, Jython 2.5) to execute Jython scripts. As a result of this version change, the whiteboard attributes, such as `http.request.uri` and `http.request.verb`, are no longer preloaded for use by Jython scripts. However, you can run a Jython script to load these attributes before they are accessed as follows:

```
from com.vordel.trace import Trace

def invoke(msg):
    msg.forceGenerateAttributes()
    Trace.info("This trace statement was generated in script filter!  [" + str(msg.get("http.request.verb")) + "] [" + str(msg.get("http.request.uri")) + "]")
    return True
```

### When an API Gateway instance is started, Xerces SAXParserImpl writes warnings to the error console

At API Gateway instance startup, the following warnings are logged to the error console, as opposed to the trace log:

```
Warning: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser: Property 'http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD' is not recognized.
Warning: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser: Property 'http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/entityExpansionLimit' is not recognized.
```

These new properties were added in JAXP 1.5 specification, which is supported by the embedded implementation in the JRE but not supported yet in Xerces-J Apache implementation. These are harmless warning messages, which are written to the error console instead of throwing an exception if a property is not supported by the Apache Xerces-J implementation.

### API Gateway web service WSDL schema validation failure

If a web service is defined using multiple WSDLs, an error of 'Cannot find the declaration of element' might occur during the schema validation of a SOAP message. This might happen because of a duplication of the WSDLs types schema `targetNamespace`. To avoid this failure, you must change the types schema `targetNamespace` to be unique across the WSDLs.

### Policy Studio installation update issue

An intermittent issue exists whereby after an installation update of Policy Studio, an error dialog is shown - "An error has occurred, see the log file", and the product will fail to start. To resolve this issue, copy the `org.apache.jasper.glassfish_2.2.2.v201205150955.jar` from the Policy Studio installation backup plugins directory to the main Policy Studio plugins directory.

Related Issue: RDAPI-26743

### YAML performance issue in Policy Studio

A Policy Studio performance issue has been observed when utilizing the YAML entity store and running on the Windows operating system. This can result in increased waiting times for certain UI user actions.

### API Catalog Swagger 2.0 export issue when multiple API Manager traffic ports configured

When exporting Swagger 2.0 from API Manager Catalog with multiple traffic ports defined, if you try to subsequently reimport the generated document into another API Manager, the back-end URLs (HTTP and HTTPS) are correctly generated but the port will be incorrect for one of the URLs.

The issue is caused by an inherent flaw in Swagger 2.0 as it only permits one host to be specified. At export time, API Manager takes the first SSL-based basePath, if one exists, from the list of available basePaths (host:port) and applies that to the `$.host` field in the resultant Swagger 2.0 definition.

For example, if an HTTPS traffic port of `8065` and an HTTP traffic port of `8066` are configured, and the host IP address is `127.0.0.1`, then the generated Swagger 2.0 definition will look like this:

```json
{
  "swagger" : "2.0",
  "info" : {
    "description" : "",
    "version" : "1.0.3",
    "title" : "Test API"
  },
  "host" : "127.0.0.1:8065",
  "basePath" : "/api",
  "schemes" : [ "https", "http" ],
  "paths" : {...}
}
```

Note that the `$.host` field specifies a port of 8065. Importing this definition back into API Manager will result in the following back-end URLs, with the HTTP port being incorrect.

* `https://127.0.0.1:8065/api`
* `http://127.0.0.1:8065/api`

The recommendation is to use OpenAPI, which has the ability to specify multiple back-end hosts. For more information, see [OpenAPI Specification, Server Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#serverObject).

### When multiple API Manager traffic ports are configured, specifying a virtual host that contains a host and port can cause conflicting base path URLs to be displayed in API Catalog

In API Manager, if a virtual host (global default, organization level, or for a published API) is set to `myhost` and there are multiple traffic ports (mix of HTTP and HTTPS) configured, API Manager correctly displays `https://myhost` and `http://myhost` as base path URLs in the API Catalog.

An issue only arises when a port is specified as part of the virtual host. API Manager blindly takes the specified virtual host and appends it to the supported schemes for the configured traffic ports. So if a virtual host of `myhost:9999` is set, then conflicting base paths of `https://myhost:9999` and `http://myhost:9999` are displayed in the API Catalog.

### API Analytics PDF reports does not display chart contents

In API Analytics, PDF reports will not contain the contents of the charts.

This issue has arised due to an upgrade of the `Highcharts.js` library.
