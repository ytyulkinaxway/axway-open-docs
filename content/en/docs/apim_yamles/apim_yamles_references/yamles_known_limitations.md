}

## Policy Studio

There is no support for YAML configurations in Policy Studio.

## API Gateway Manager web UI

Deployment of YAML configurations via API Gateway Manager web UI is not supported.

## Team development

* Support of Team development using `yamles import` command, where you must import each project one at a time.
* No explicit support for project dependencies.
* No explicit support to look for merge conflicts. You must use `_fragment.yaml` directives to manage it.

For more information, see [Team development with YAML configuration](/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_references/yamles_team_development).

## ES Explorer

Support of ES Explorer is limited to viewing and editing YAML configurations.

When an entity store is edited via ES Explorer or the entity store API, some fields in other entities might get reordered, creating more `diffs` than what was really modified.

## Config fragment

* You can convert an XML configuration fragment to YAML.
* You can view and edit the YAML configuration fragment in ES Explorer.
* It is not yet possible to import or export YAML configuration fragments in ES Explorer, this can only be done using the `yamles` CLI.

## API Manager

The YAML format supports API Manager. However, is not possible to run `setup-apimanager` on an API Gateway instance that has a YAML configuration deployed to it. To workaround this limitation:

1. Run `setup-apimanager` after deploying an XML federated configuration to your group.
2. When API Manager is setup, you can create a new project in Policy Studio by downloading the current configuration from the running API Gateway.
3. If the configuration is downloaded to `~/apiprojects/apimanager` you can convert this XML federated configuration to YAML and build a `.tar.gz` as follows:

    ```
    yamles fed2yaml federated:file:/home/user/apiprojects/configs.xml -o ~/yamlconfig --targz ~/yamlconfig.tar.gz
    ```

4. Deploy the `yamlconfig.tar.gz` to the API Manager enabled instance using `managedomain` or `projdeploy`.

{{< alert title="Note">}}
The format of API Manager data stored in Cassandra is the same regardless of whether a YAML configuration or an XML federated configuration is deployed.

## Encrypt or change the passphrase of YAML configuration that contains API Manager configuration

When the default factory API Manager configuration is included in the YAML configuration it cannot be encrypted or re-encrypted. This issue occurs because some fields in the factory configuration do not adhere to the cardinality defined in the Entity Store model.

This issue occurs when the `encrypt` or `change-passphrase` options are used in the `yamles` CLI tool, or when the group passphrase is changed through the `managedomain --change_passphrase` command.

To workaround this, add values or a `/null` value, for the missing fields.

## Node Manager

YAML configuration for Node manager is not supported.

## API Gateway Analytics

YAML configuration for Analytics is not supported.

## Deployment archive

You can update the deployment archive package properties by choosing `option 22` of the `managedomain` script. For more information, see [Updating Deployment Archive Properties](/docs/apim_yamles/yamles_packaging_deployment/#updating-deployment-archive-properties).
