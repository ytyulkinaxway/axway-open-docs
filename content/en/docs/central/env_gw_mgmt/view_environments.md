    * Services: The total count of API services represented in the environment.
    * Catalog Items: The total count of published catalog items.
    * Subscriptions: The total count of subscribers to all the published catalog items.

You can search by title, name, or tag. For each API service, it shows the number of versions, the user who last modified the API service, and when.
